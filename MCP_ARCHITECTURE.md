# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Architecture

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. This document explores the fundamental architecture and design principles of MCP.

## Core MCP Concepts

### What is MCP?

MCP enables AI assistants (like Claude) to securely access external resources through standardized interfaces. Rather than building custom integrations for every data source, MCP provides a universal protocol for:

- **Tools**: Functions the AI can call to perform actions
- **Resources**: Data sources the AI can read from
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates

### MCP Server Lifecycle - Key Understanding

**Question**: Does the MCP server work in the way that it starts just when the request comes in and after processing the request it stops?

**Answer**: Yes, exactly! This is a fundamental characteristic of MCP servers that differs from traditional web servers.

## MCP Architecture Principles

### 1. Process-Based Isolation

**Short-lived Process Model:**
- MCP servers are designed as **ephemeral processes**
- They start when a client needs to use them
- They run for the duration of the conversation/session
- They terminate when the client disconnects or the session ends

### 2. Communication Protocol

**JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio:**
- Servers communicate via standard input/output
- No network ports or HTTP endpoints required
- Messages are JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted
- Bidirectional communication channel

### 3. Capability-Based Design

**Dynamic Tool Discovery:**
- Servers advertise their capabilities on startup
- Clients can query available tools/resources
- Type-safe parameter validation
- Rich metadata for tool descriptions

## MCP vs Traditional Server Architecture

### Traditional Web Server Model
```
Client → HTTP Request → Web Server (always running)
                     ↓
                  Database/API
                     ↓
              HTTP Response ← Web Server
```

**Characteristics:**
- Continuously running processes
- Network-based communication (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Stateful across requests
- Port-based addressing
- Multiple concurrent clients

### MCP Server Model
```
Client (Claude/IDE) → Spawns Process → MCP Server
                                    ↓
                                stdio pipe
                                    ↓
                           JSON-RPC messages
                                    ↓
                         Process External APIs
                                    ↓
                         JSON-RPC responses
                                    ↓
                           Process terminates
```

**Characteristics:**
- Ephemeral, session-based processes
- stdio-based communication
- Fresh state per session
- Process-based addressing
- Single client per process instance

## Protocol Flow

### 1. Initialization Handshake
```json
Client → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05"}}
Server → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"capabilities":{"tools":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"server","version":"1.0"}}}
```

### 2. Capability Discovery
```json
Client → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","params":{}}
Server → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"tools":[{"name":"search","description":"Search data"}]}}
```

### 3. Tool Execution
```json
Client → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search","arguments":{"query":"test"}}}
Server → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Results..."}]}}
```

## Security Model

### Process Boundary Security
- Each MCP server runs in its own process
- Operating system provides process isolation
- No shared memory between sessions
- Clean startup/shutdown cycle

### Communication Security
- No network exposure (stdio only)
- No authentication complexity
- Parent process controls server lifecycle
- Input/output streams are isolated

### Data Access Control
- Servers only access resources they're configured for
- No persistent state means no data leakage between sessions
- Client controls which servers to spawn and when

## Design Benefits

### For Developers
- **Simple Protocol**: JSON-RPC is well-understood
- **No Network Complexity**: stdio eliminates port management
- **Process Isolation**: Strong boundaries between tools
- **Language Agnostic**: Any language that handles stdio works

### For Users
- **Security**: Process boundaries provide strong isolation
- **Resource Efficiency**: No idle processes consuming resources
- **Reliability**: Fresh state prevents accumulated errors
- **Simplicity**: No server management or configuration

### For AI Systems
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Runtime capability detection
- **Type Safety**: Structured parameter validation
- **Rich Metadata**: Detailed tool descriptions for AI reasoning
- **Composability**: Multiple servers can be combined

## MCP Ecosystem

### Client Applications
- Claude Desktop
- IDEs (VS Code, etc.)
- Custom applications via MCP SDKs

### Server Types
- Database connectors
- API integrators
- File system tools
- Development tools
- Custom business logic

### Transport Layers
- stdio (primary)
- HTTP (for remote servers)
- WebSocket (for real-time applications)

## Protocol Extensions

### Future Capabilities
- Resource subscriptions for real-time updates
- Bidirectional tool calls (server calling client)
- Enhanced authentication mechanisms
- Protocol versioning and compatibility

This architecture makes MCP uniquely suited for AI integration - providing the security, simplicity, and flexibility needed for AI assistants to safely interact with external systems.
